# deep-learn-galaxy-bars

This project uses data from the Galaxy Zoo Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge). I built a convolutional neural network based off the Keras examples (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/tree/master/examples), specifically https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/cifar10_cnn.py. 

I have uploaded my juypter notebook notebook that shows how I built a convolutional neural network to identify bars in galaxies with 90% accuracy. The background to Galaxy Zoo can be found in the Kaggle website, but briefly, Galaxy Zoo is a citizen science project that uses the public to classify the morphological features of galaxy images. I've used my 2013 paper, which uses Galaxy Zoo classifications, as a reference for some of the assumptions I make in the jupyter notebook.
